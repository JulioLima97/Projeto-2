# Project 2
## Project Description
In this project I had to prepare a report for the loan division of a bank. I need to find out if a client's marital status and number of children have an impact on loan default. The bank already has some data on customers' creditworthiness.

## Data description
- `children`: the number of children in the family
- `days_employed`: how long the customer worked
- `dob_years`: the customer's age
- `education`: the customer's education level
- `education_id`: client education identifier
- `family_status` : marital status of the client
- `family_status_id`: identifier of the client's marital status
- `gender`: the customerâ€™s sex
- `income_type`: the customer's income type
- `debt`: if the customer has already failed to pay a loan
- `total_income`: monthly income
- `purpose`: reason for taking out a loan
